# The Disappearing Act

![Live Demo of Code](https://github.com/freddiebz/Cursive-ish/blob/main/code/assets/demo.gif)

A computational art piece that writes cursive-like figures using common shapes seen in cursive writing. Words and letters are generated randomly and move erratically as more words are written on the page. Once the page is filled, the curves expand past legibility as they fade away, representing the fading of cursive in the modern world.

Created using p5.js
